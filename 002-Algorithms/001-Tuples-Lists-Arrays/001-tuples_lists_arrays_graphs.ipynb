In step 1, we check whether the middle element of the sequence is equal to `target`; if not, we halve the sequence and continue the search in the appropriate subsequence whose size is now globally equal to $n/2$. We repeat the process $k$ times in the worst case before finding `target` or not. At each stage, we access only one element of the sequence (the middle one). So, the number of times we access the sequence (let's note $k$) corresponds to the number of times we need to divide the sequence by 2 to find `target`.\n",

    "$k$ is linked to the size $n$ of the sequence by the following relationship: $n = 2^k$. You can obtain this relationship by making a binary tree. For example, if the sequence size is $16$, the 1st division gives $(8, 8)$ as the subsequence size, and we keep only one subsequence. The 2nd division gives $4$, the 3rd $2$ and the 4th $1$. So, for $n = 16$, we have $4$ divisions, i.e. $16 = 2^4$. If we repeat the operation with $n = 32$, we get 5 divisions, i.e. $32 = 2^5$. The same applies to $64$, $128$, ...\n",
