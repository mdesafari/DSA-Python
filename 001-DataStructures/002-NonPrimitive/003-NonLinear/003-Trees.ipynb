    "A `tree` is a widely used data structure in computer science that represents a hierarchical structure. It consists of `nodes` connected by `edges`, where each node can have zero or more `child nodes`. The topmost node is called the `root`, and nodes without any children are called `leaves`.\n",

    "## **Types of Trees (not exhaustive)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **General Tree**: In a general tree, nodes can have any number of `child nodes`. There is `no restriction` on the `branching factor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary Tree (BT)**: A binary tree is a special type of tree where each `node` has `at most two child nodes`: a `left child` and a `right child`. **`The order of insertion is important in a binary tree`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary search tree is a `binary tree` with an additional property: for any given node, all `nodes` in its left subtree have `values less` than the node's value, and all `nodes` in its right subtree have `values greater` than the node's value. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations."
