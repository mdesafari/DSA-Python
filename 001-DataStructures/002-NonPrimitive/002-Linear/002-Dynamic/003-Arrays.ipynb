    "\n",
    "`Arrays` are another dynamic data structure with some notable differences from `lists`. In Python, `NumPy` library offers powerful ways to create and manipulate arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note: What is a library?**\n",
    "> A `library` is a collection of pre-written code that provides a set of functions, modules, and classes that can be used to perform specific tasks. Libraries are designed to simplify the development process by providing reusable code and implementing commonly needed functionality, such as mathematical operations, data manipulation, networking, web development, and more.\n",
    "> Python libraries are typically distributed as `packages`, which are directory structures containing Python modules and other resources. Packages can be installed using package managers like `pip`, which allows you to easily download and install libraries from the Python Package Index (`PyPI`) or other sources."

    "* **Mutability**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Lists` in Python are `mutable`, meaning you can modify their size and contents by adding, removing, or changing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NumPy arrays have a `fixed size` and `shape`, and their elements are typically of the `same data type`. Once created, you cannot change the size or data type of a NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can modify the elements of a `Numpy Array` or `reshape` it (but at same number of elements): e.g., from 2D $(n, m)$ to 1D $(n \\times m,)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Homogeneity**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Lists` can store elements of `different data types`, allowing for `heterogeneous` collections. In contrast, `NumPy arrays` are `homogeneous`, meaning all elements must have the `same data type`. **This homogeneity enables more efficient storage and computation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "`NumPy arrays` are designed for numerical computations and offer `superior` performance compared to `lists`, especially when dealing with large datasets or performing vectorized operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dimensionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easier to create and manipulate N-dimensional data with Numpy arrays than with lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides a rich set of mathematical functions and operations optimized for `arrays`, such as element-wise operations, linear algebra, statistical functions, and more. `Lists`, while flexible, do not have built-in mathematical operations and require explicit iteration or list comprehensions for similar functionality.\n"

For example, a 1-dimensional array (often called a `vector`) has a single dimension, a 2-dimensional array (often called a `matrix`) has two dimensions, and so on. The `number of dimensions` is also known as the `rank of the array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Shape`: the shape of a Numpy array describes the **size of each dimension**. It is a tuple that specifies the **number of elements along each axis**. For example, a 1-dimensional array with 5 elements has a shape of (5,), a 2-dimensional array with 3 rows and 4 columns has a shape of (3, 4), and so on. The shape of an array is determined by the lengths of its axes."
